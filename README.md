# Chatting-Sockets
I have built a new project using Java Swing and Sockets.

Java swing is used to Java Swing provides a set of components (like JPanel, JLabel, JButton, etc.) that can be used to create a graphical user interface.  Swing allows for extensive customization of components, such as setting text, colors, fonts, and sizes.  Swing components support event-driven programming. In this code, action listeners are used (implementing ActionListener) to handle events such as button clicks (e.g., sending messages) and mouse clicks (e.g., exiting the application).
Socket Programming - The chat application establishes a client-server connection using sockets (Socket class) to send and receive messages over the network. Swing components are integrated into this network communication structure to display sent and received messages within the GUI. Sockets allow communication between different devices over a network. In this scenario, the code establishes a socket connection between a client (running the chat application) and a server (which could be handling multiple clients).Sockets enable bidirectional communication, allowing both sending and receiving messages between the client and server. This bidirectional nature is crucial for a chat application, where participants need to exchange messages back and forth. Sockets provide a foundation for networking capabilities in Java. They allow developers to create applications that can communicate over various network protocols (TCP or UDP) and across different devices.

So from this project I have put to use all the concepts regarding java swing and sockets programming which I have learnt theoretically.
